# File: tests/conftest.py
# Purpose: Centralized pytest fixtures for async testing of my FastAPI app.
# Notes: I load environment variables once per test session, expose the ASGI app,
# and provide an httpx AsyncClient so tests can hit routes without running uvicorn.

import pytest
import httpx
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# I load .env once at import time so all session-scoped fixtures see the same config.
# Expected keys: GITHUB_TOKEN, OWNER, REPO, WEBHOOK_SECRET, etc.

    for the entire test session. This keeps timing consistent across tests.

    I provide an async HTTP client that talks to the ASGI app directlyâ€”
    no uvicorn process needed. This makes tests fast and deterministic.
